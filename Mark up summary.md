City officials are looking to publicize and improve the city bike program.

Question:  Who rides the bikes the longest on average?

Hours by Age Group:  

- Calculated field to determine the age from the birth year
- Grouping the ages into categories
- Calculated field for average hours from total seconds 
- Using average trip durations by hours for the circle size

We can see the 17 to 21 age group rides the bikes the longest of .94 hours on average per ride.  The 50-60 age group rides the next longest on average of .686 hours per ride.

Hours by Gender:

- Converting (1) and (2) numerical values to Male & Female
- Using gender count to show size of circle

We can see females ride the bikes longer on average than males.

Hours by Station:

- Using starting stations and showing user type by color

We can see Union Street riders use the bikes the longest on average over 2.5 hours, with the majority of the users being customers not subscribers.  Sip Avenue station riders only ride for 30 minutes on average.

Summary:

Assuming the longer the ride, the higher the revenue, significant revenues are coming from 17 to 21 year old, females, and Union Street Station.  

Question:  What type of users ride the bikes most often?

Use by Month:

- Combining 12 months rolling files for 4-2020 to 3 -2021

The bikes are ridden most often between May and October.

User by User Type:

For both subscribers and customers, 6pm (18 hour) is the peak time for bike rides.

There are more male subscribers than female subscribers.

Although there are less subscribers, they ride the bikes more often than customers and provide more complete data on their gender.  Is price the only incentive for subscribers?  Are they guaranteed a bike will be available?  

Ride count by Station:

Newport  Parkway is the station with the most frequent bike riders and the most frequent customer bike riders.  Could these customers be turned into subscribers?  Grove Street is the next highest ride count with the majority being subscribers.  Liberty is third with almost all rides by customers.  This is another opportunity to convert customers to subscribers.
